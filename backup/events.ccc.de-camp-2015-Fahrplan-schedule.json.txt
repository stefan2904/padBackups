It is intended to be a minimal or zero-configuration option that most Internet users can use to prevent non-consensual third party collection of their reading habits from their everyday browser. Privacy Badger couples the recently developed HTTP Do Not Track opt-out header with a number of heuristics for classifying the behavior of third parties, to automatically determine which should be blocked, which are needed but should have cookies blocked, and which are safe from a privacy perspective. They will also talk about the current state of non-consensual tracking on the web, what methods are currently being used to track people and exploring what alternatives we can pursue.","description":"In this presentation we will address the state of online tracking. We will discuss the prevalence of tracking online, describe who is participating in it, explain the adverse effects for common web users, and then discuss what can be done to protect yourself from being tracked.\r\n\r\nWebsites have long ceased to be simple static html pages, and are now made up of many different resources distributed across the web. Over the course of a day of browsing the web, even if the number of sites we visit is small, we often broadcast information about the sites we go to to hundreds of third parties. These third parties have the ability to aggregate information about our browsing across many first party domains, enabling them to track what we read on the web. To many Internet users these third parties are invisible, and just as invisible are the ways in which they can uniquely identify you as you browse. As these forms of tracking become more ubiquitous and as data resellers grow in prevelance users need to have ways to protect themselves and their privacy.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will cover the technical details of how third parties determine your identity on the web, and how they aggregate that information across websites. We will talk about the implications this has for web users' privacy and security. Additionally we will talk about the legal and policy work that has been done to rein in this sort of tracking. Finally we will discuss the Privacy Badger project, and how it protects users as they browse the web.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover the following issues in detail:\r\nWays in which advertising companies track users, how spy agencies and other bad actors piggyback on this info, and how to stop them.\r\nSpecifically IP addresses, 'tracking' cookies, super cookies, and browser fingerprinting.\r\nHow you can protect yourself from these forms of data collection and how Privacy Badger works.\r\nWhy other kinds of privacy plug-ins and features fail to protect users from tracking\r\nWays that the EFF is working to rein in browsing tracking through law and policy.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk you will be informed about the types of tracking that occur online and feel empowered to do something to protect yourself from it.

The digital dividend through the digitization of terrestrial TV offers an important opportunity for better coverage and more bandwidth for all. Unfortunately, the UHF-TV spectrum is being auctioned off to the big telecommunications companies. As a result, broadband usage remains expensive. The UHF-band mesh network of the \"Freifunk\" open wireless radio networks community in Berlin is a first step in a different direction.","description":"Serious media use does not work without WiFi or LAN cable and also free and open wireless community infrastructure like Freifunk would be hardly conceivable without WLAN. 3G and 4G is good in between WiFi and LAN access just for frugal internet use.\r\n\r\nThe 2.4 GHz wireless frequency band is a big mess. Here, the WLAN users are crammed into only four non-overlapping WiFi channels\u00b9. In order to increase the chaos yet there's also remote-controlled toys, Bluetooth, wireless audio and video transmission systems, surveillance cameras, microwave ovens. Many of theses applications are transmitting uncoordinated. Scoffers refer to the 2.4 GHz band for its modest properties as 'junk band' - and yet it has become an important resource in our infrastructure, if not the most important resource alongside WLAN in the 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz WLAN frequency band offers more space, but because of even more pronounced quasi-optical properties, the range for local broadband coverage is even lower and soon also LTE networks are allowed to use this resource. (And LTE is going to share the spectrum in an unfair manner because of differences in the protocol, but that is a different subject.)\r\n\r\nThere are ways to improve the digital broadband coverage: Due to the switch of terrestrial analog TV to DVB-T, now a major part of the UHF TV frequency spectrum is unused - the digital dividend. This frequency range has substantially better properties than the radio channels at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz: objects such as trees and shrubs attenuate the signal much less. It is much easier to provide a broad range WLAN coverage in that part of the frequency spectrum.\r\n\r\nMuch of the TV band is soon to be auctioned to the telco industry or has already been auctioned. We always hear from politicians that the public purse has benefited enormously from the revenues from spectrum auctions. This warm rain for the Treasury is going to be financed by us, the Internet users and Telco customers, by the extra expense for broadband usage that we are spending. In effect, such spectrum auctions are a hidden tax for wireless broadband access.\r\n\r\nBut there might be a better way: A dedicated part of the currently unused TV channels could also be dedicated to unlicensed, digital broadband operation with WiFi. Everyone involved would benefit - the mobile operators, because the large telecommunications companies are already using unlicensed Wi-Fi to do \"mobile offloading\": Your DSL-WiFi router at home might already provide a commercial hotspot for the telecommunications company you are renting the DSL line from, in order to serve broadband to their customers on the street in front of your flat. The resulting cost savings for the large telcos are estimated to be over 80 billion in 2015.\r\n\r\nThe session presents the TV-Whitespace hardware project, which has been developed by Freifunk, its background and goals.\r\n\r\n(\u00b9 These are the channels 1, 5, 9, 13: The frequency channels between them should not be used it, as they interfere with the adjacent wireless channels and the channel access between different wireless networks can not be coordinated effectively.)","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":1281,"full_public_name":"Elektra"}],"links":[{"url":"http://wiki.freifunk.net/MABB:TVWS","title":"Freifunk im TV-Whitespace"}]},{"id":6857,"guid":"eab5b0db-c441-4f14-89eb-939585061555","logo":"/system/logos/6857/medium/topsecret.png?1438210757","date":"2015-08-13T20:00:00+02:00","start":"20:00","duration":"01:00","room":"B","slug":"camp2015-6857-nsa-untersuchungsausschuss_-_wer_kontrolliert_wen","title":"NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss - Wer kontrolliert wen?","subtitle":"Zwischen den geschw\u00e4rzten Zeilen lesen","track":"Ethics, Society & Politics","type":"lecture","language":"de","abstract":"Der NSA-Untersuchungsausschuss ist zum BND-Untersuchungsausschuss geworden.

","description":"After the Snowden revelations, demand for encrypted end-to-end communication has skyrocketed, even amongst ordinary users. As also shown by the catastrophic fate of Lavabit, running a high-security communications provider is fraught with danger, both political and technical. Yet today we see services that essentially sell security \"snake oil\" taking off with users, while real end-to-end encryption is barely used by activists, much less ordinary people. We still have do not have widespread deployment of OpenPGP, and post-email messaging protocols such as OpenWhisper still have less than a million users. Fundamental standards such as OpenPGP existing for over thirty years, but software such as Enigmail is still claimed to be virtually unusable. What is the source of this massive failure, and how can it be fixed? \r\n\r\n How can we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging? This roundtable will bring together software projects working in this space to reflect on their future, debate their differences, and possibly develop a common strategy for the future. Questions to be addressed are:\r\n\r\n1.  Are standards the solution or the problem? The IETF has recently re-opened the OpenPGP mailing list, and there is discussion around the Darkmail (DIME) protocols brewing. However, even the OpenPGP Working Group is not tackling the hard problems of metadata protection. Another strategy is to ditch e-mail entirely and go with new protocols such as TextSecure, but these protocols are still not federated and are thus centralized with particular applications. Decentralized blockchain-based messaging alternatives have also not taken off.\r\n\r\n2. Why is the software still unusable by ordinary users? Two years onwards, we still do not have a better interface than Thunderbird, which has been abandoned by Mozilla. Mailpile is still in beta. Pixelated is still under development. Furthermore, how do we communicate to users if their messages are secure or not?\r\n\r\n3. What research problems remain open? Currently, e-mail leaks metadata through the header, as well as through timing information and network traffic. Keyservers remain broken in terms of authentication and also reveal the social graph while key revocation and signing is difficult. Academic work on mix networking and privacy-enhancing technologies desperately needs to \r\n\r\n4. How can we reach critical mass? Some companies such as OpenWhisper are now working with major providers such as WhatsApp. Others such as LEAP are working so that anyone can run their own provider. Start-ups such as Peer.io and Protonmail are pursuing centralized strategies, and even Gmail and Yahoo! are working on end-to-end encryption. Governments such as Brazil and Germany are pushing for nationalized or public-private partnerships for encrypted email, while business models in the 'privacy market' are still unclear at best and seem to be unable to take into account distributed systems. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this even is to bring together key voices in this space so we combat the fundamental problems afflicting encrypted messaging, from e-mail to beyond, so that it becomes a fundamental right for all people to have end-to-end encrypted messaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":3615,"full_public_name":"harryhalpin"},{"id":5619,"full_public_name":"meskio"}],"links":[{"url":"http://leap.se","title":"LEAP"}]},{"id":6734,"guid":"535ed08a-9699-47eb-b2b2-aff3992fcf18","logo":null,"date":"2015-08-14T17:45:00+02:00","start":"17:45","duration":"00:30","room":"A","slug":"camp2015-6734-security_and_usability_in_open_source","title":"Security and Usability in Open Source","subtitle":"What to do, what not to do","track":"Other","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"Tools for encryption and circumventing censorship have developed a reputation for being confusing and difficult to use.

Couple that with spawning of antibiotic resistant bacteria caused by modern farming practices, along with the suffering of the animals themselves, and it's a full blown disaster.  At the same time, cheese is often cited by people as the reason they could never go vegan.  Vegan cheese substitutes have been increasing in quality, but still are not satisfying for many people.\r\n  In the modern age of genetic engineering, however, animals should not be needed to produce cheese.  It is a single protein complex, casein, which is responsible for most of cheese's properties such as melting and stretching.  The genes responsible for producing casein are sequenced for many animals, and so it should be possible to engineer other organisms, such as yeast, to make casein as well.  This is the goal of the Real Vegan Cheese project.\r\n  This project started in the spring of 2014 as a collaboration between Biocurious in Sunnyvale, CA and Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA.  Beyond the goal of producing a real cheese in a vegan process, we also formed to enter the international genetically engineered machines competition and show that community labs could compete with academic labs (tl;dr we won), and to provide alternative educational pathways for people interested in learning genetic engineering.

The intention is not to present any new results, but instead the emphasis is on gaining a foundation in the theory of such attacks, so that you will be able to apply them more effectively in more challenging scenarios. As we shall see, such attacks are an extension of other types of side-channel attack (timing and power analysis attacks in particular), with the added promise of bridging air gaps.","description":"We open by introducing the subject of side-channel attacks with a short review of them in general, and focus on key examples of acoustic cryptanalysis in the literature, including analysis of keyboard emanations, a brief look at an historical account of an attack on the Hagelin cipher machine that played a critical role in the Suez Crisis of the 1950's and the more recent results of Genkin, Shamir and Tromer, which forms the primary basis and inspiration of the techniques we will discuss.\r\nWe start the technical section of our talk by giving a background to power supplies for microcomputer systems, initially reviewing linear power supplies, so we have a basis on which we can compare them to the operating principles of switch-mode power supplies that form the key element of acoustic attacks. Along the way, we look at the important design principle of feedback and the relation this has to frequency response, which in turn gives us an estimate of the bandwidth of emanated signal available to us. Then, we explore the mechanisms by which key components of switch-mode power supplies can be caused to generate unwanted acoustics, show just how readily they will do so and how rich the spectral content of such signals can be.\r\nOur next task will be to look at signal acquisition techniques, where we scratch build an ultrasonic USB microphone with 125kHz of bandwidth, for a price at least two orders of magnitude cheaper than commercially available alternatives, yet still sensitive enough to capture the signals of interest. Specifically, we survey options for transducers, the design of the analog signal path and take a look at high data throughput techniques based on DMA to ensure that we can maintain the data rates required. We then discuss difficulties encountered in getting our signal from our data acquisition board into our data analysis system.\r\nSince a considerable amount of the literature on side-channel attacks, particularly simple and differential power analysis attacks, deals with attacks on block ciphers such the Advanced Encryption Standard, rather than public key cryptosystems such as RSA (as dealt with in the Genkin, Shamir and Tromer paper), the focus of our attack will be AES. We will quickly review the processing steps involved in AES and then develop a naive implementation of AES-128, paying particular attention to the construction of the S-boxes, since the data-dependent lookup times are the source of timing variations. Our attack is essentially an adaptation of the classic cache timing attack described by Daniel J. Bernstein, where the leaked timing information is obtained instead via the acoustic channel. Our target machine will be a netbook with an Intel Atom N270 (24kB L1 cache, 512KB L2 cache) together with a cheap and particularly noisy AC power supply (model PA-1700-02). We will discuss passive techniques to improve sound amplification in our test setup which will be familar to anyone who has played a stringed musical instrument.\r\nFinally, we move into the data processing and attack implementation section of the talk. In order to determine the run-time of our AES implementation for a given key, we will first need to be able to distinguish the difference in acoustic emanation of the system under load, compared to the idle-load condition. To do this, we will use the discrete-time Fourier transform of the acoustic signal, focusing on a suitable band of frequencies, where changes in amplitude correlate with CPU load changes. This will involve a discussion of the choice of FFT frame size against spectral resolution, choice of suitable windowing function and filtering techniques, to enable us to distinguish more accurately the transition from idle-load to load states.\r\nThe attack itself is conducted along the same lines as Bernstein's, with the victim machine running the AES process as a server to which we send UDP packets from our analysis machine, with plaintexts that are then encrypted by the server using its private key. The attack proceeds in two phases. The first involves using known keys and measuring the aggregate encryption time of each, thereby gathering statistics about key-dependent biases in the runtimes. In the second phase, the server chooses a random key which we are not told and we use the previously gathered statistics, together with data from a large sample of suitably chosen plaintexts, that we send to determine bit-by-bit the unknown private key. We spend some time considering options for statistical analyses that might lead to a possible reduction in the number of samples necessary to extract the complete key.\r\nConcluding the talk we discuss standard techniques to mitigate side-channel attacks found in the literature, as well as possible further extensions of the attack presented. It is hoped this will set the scene for the discussion section of the talk, where these ideas can be explored further.","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":5489,"full_public_name":"Dan Hagon"}],"links":[]},{"id":6634,"guid":"54159b05-db61-4055-b2ae-f4a16559ccfe","logo":"/system/logos/6634/medium/hispeed.jpg?1428571158","date":"2015-08-14T21:15:00+02:00","start":"21:15","duration":"01:00","room":"B","slug":"camp2015-6634-pushing_the_limits_of_diy_electronics","title":"Pushing the limits of DIY electronics","subtitle":"Bridging the gap between DIY and professional electronics","track":"Hardware & Making","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"DIY electronics often means Arduinos and breadboards.

Surveillance was mainstream and hackers' voices were heard. Snowden broke the barrier between the paranoids and the skeptics and amalgamated some consensus that all this surveillance is too much. But let's face it, we hoped for a better outcome. Surveillance bills are being passed in many European countries, the U.S. has taken little action and the United Kingdom is becoming the standard for privacy failures.\r\n\r\nGovernment hacking is on the rise, partially because of the increasing inability to wiretap due to the rise of encryption, but partially also because it has become inexpensive. While mass surveillance is a more obvious breach of human and constitutional rights, targeted surveillance is generally tolerated as a necessary evil. However, what we discovered is that this tolerance has nurtured not only an industry of surveillance, but an indiscriminate adoption of very invasive technologies and their legitimization and exemption from regulated use.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, while only cypherpunks have picked up the slack and started pushing development of encrypted communication technologies, the rest of the security and tech community has done little in response to the revelations of the last years as well as to the general cry for help. Hyped vulnerabilities, hacking of cars and gadgets is making headlines again, while the global civil society remains under heavy attack and is left helpless.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll go through many examples of targeted surveillance employed by governments all around the world and we'll try to understand the taxonomy and nature of these attacks from a technical and from a political perspective.

With access to the destroyed pieces, we investigated what GCHQ's instructions were and what we can learn from it about securely eradicating data on a machine.","description":"While the initial disclosures by Edward Snowden revealed how US authorities are conducting mass surveillance on the world's communications, further reporting by the Guardian newspaper uncovered that UK intelligence services were just as involved in this global spying apparatus. Faced with the prospect of further public scrutiny and accountability, the UK Government gave the Guardian newspaper an ultimatum: hand over the classified documents or destroy them.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian decided that having the documents destroyed was the best option. By getting rid of only the documents stored on computers in the UK, it would allow Guardian journalists to continue their work from other locations while acquiescing to the Government's demand. However, rather than trust that the Guardian would destroy the information on their computers to the Government's satisfaction, GCHQ sent two representatives to supervise the operation. Typically, reliable destruction of such hardware in the circumstances would be to shred or melt all electronic components using a much larger version of the common paper shredder and leaving only the dust of the original devices. Indeed, some devices such as external USB sticks were turned to dust.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, it might have been expected that GCHQ would solely target the hard drives of the devices in question. The hard drives, after all, are one of the few components of a computer where user data is supposed to be retained after the power to the device is removed.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, however, GCHQ were not just interested in hard drives nor did they destroy whole devices. An examination of the targeted hardware by Privacy International, with cooperation from the Guardian, has found the whole episode to be more troubling and puzzling than previously believed.\r\n\r\nDuring our investigation, we were surprised to learn that a few very specific components on devices, such as the keyboard, trackpad and monitor, were targeted along with apparently trivial chips on the main boards of laptops and desktops. Initial consultation with members of the technology community supported our identification of the components and that the actions of GCHQ were worth analysing further.\r\n\r\nIn light of GCHQ's actions, we have asked hardware manufacturers to explain what these elements actually do: what information can be stored on a device, how much information it can retain, and for how long.","do_not_record":false,"persons":[{"id":4905,"full_public_name":"Mustafa Al-Bassam"},{"id":5750,"full_public_name":"Richard Tynan"}],"links":[]},{"id":6833,"guid":"2cce4d76-619d-4f60-b7e9-28e8ee9d6483","logo":"/system/logos/6833/medium/privdog-cert.png?1435749019","date":"2015-08-16T22:30:00+02:00","start":"22:30","duration":"01:00","room":"A","slug":"camp2015-6833-tls_interception_considered_harmful","title":"TLS interception considered harmful","subtitle":"How Man-in-the-Middle filtering solutions harm the security of HTTPS","track":"Security & Hacking","type":"lecture","language":"en","abstract":"With the more widespread use of encrypted HTTPS connections many software vendors intercept these connections by installing a certificate into the user's browser.

But even if implemented properly these solutions almost always decrease the security of HTTPS.","description":"In February a software called Superfish was detected preinstalled on Lenovo laptops that would intercept HTTPS connections by installing a certificate into the user's browser. This certificate was shared amongst different installations and therefore an extraction of the certificate allowed creating rogue certificates that would be accepted by many Lenovo laptops. Shortly after Superfish many other software products with the same or similar vulnerabilities were found. The speaker of this talk discovered that the software Privdog, advertised by the certificate authority Comodo, had an even worse vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSuperfish and Privdog were extreme examples, but the technology of intercepting HTTPS connections by installing X.509 root certificates into the browser is widespread. These solutions are often part of software that is supposed to bring more security to the user - like Antivirus applications - but they lower the user's security.

In this talk, I'll discuss both sides of the argument, with concrete examples of how the different strategies have been used in various situations. ","description":"For some marginalised communities, not being represented in certain institutional datasets means their needs don't have a chance of being met. The first step for changing this, for many anti-discrimination campaigners, is to be counted and to appear in those datasets, and thus have a chance at being reflected in decision making that might stem from the data.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of many privacy campaigners, though, the exact opposite is true. Being reflected in data might do more harm to those marginalised communities, for whom operating under the radar or anonymously might be crucial to their livelihoods. \r\n\r\nWhat can we learn from the way in which different marginalised communities have been reflected in data in the past?

This presentation will describe how the centers can be started based on previous experience. It will discuss variety of options how to get funding to open its doors and consequently how to keep the lights on. Also the legal structure like for-profit, non-profit etc will be discussed. \r\n\r\nIn summary the aim is to share the experience about how to start up places like this to stimulate their spread, interlinking them and helping them to prosper.

This project is focused on promotion and development of food sustainability in local rural communities using variety of fermentation cultures and techniques. The goal is to use the regionally available alimentary resources, preserve them in the time of abundance for periods when they are scarce and process part of them into higher value products for recreational use and trade. This is going to be achieved by selecting appropriate fermentation cultures/microbes and adequate techniques which will be combining the traditional knowledge and state of the art technology, resulting in scheme aimed on small to medium production. Fermentation facility will be designed to suit the needs of rural areas including production, educational and experimental purposes. Next step will be creation of training program which will allow to the interested participants to master these techniques and carry out the production. As the final step, the participants will be motivated to start their own businesses supporting therefore the green collar worker scheme and local economy.

For example, the field of biology changed forever after the microscope revealed the existence of cells. In this talk I hope to convey some of the great technological leaps in detector technology in astronomy, and what those leaps have allowed us to learn about the nature of the universe. A small sampling of what you can expect to hear about is listed below.\r\n\r\nMy own PhD research was focused on the cosmic microwave background (remnant radiation from the big bang), which is best viewed with mm-wavelength detectors. This wavelength range is notoriously difficult to work in, and we have to operate our superconducting detectors a mere .25 degrees above absolute zero.\r\n\r\nOther experiments aim to measure neutrinos, which are particles that almost never interact with anything. But how do you measure something that only interacts rarely with your detector? One experiment's solution is to use a several cubic kilometer slab of the Antarctic ice cap as a the detector--the \"just make it bigger\" approach.\r\n\r\nIn practice, there are always problems that crop up when working at the edges of human understanding and the laws of physics, some fundamental, and some mundane but hilarious.
